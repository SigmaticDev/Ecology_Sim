            <p>

            </p>
        <h3>References</h3>
        <!-- 
            1 - Provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS.
            2 - Identify each document by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization.
            3 - Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h3>Document Overview</h3>
        <!--

            </p>
        <h2>General Description</h2>
        <!-- 
            1 - Describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements.
            2 - Does not state specific requirements.
            3 - Provides background for those requirements.
        -->
        <h3>Product Perspective</h3>
        <!-- 
            1 - Put the product into perspective with other related products. If the project is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here.
            2 - If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should identify interfaces between that system and the software.
            3 - A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
            4 - Describe how the software operates inside various constraints. These could include:
        -->
        <h4>System Interfaces</h4>
        <!-- 
            1 - List each system interface and identify the functionality of the software to accomplish the system requirement and the interface description to match the system.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h4>User Interfaces</h4>
        <!-- 
            1 - The logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users. This includes those configuration characteristics (e.g. required screen formats, page or window layouts, content of any reports or menus, or availability of programmable function keys) necessary to accomplish the software requirements.
            2 - All the aspects of optimizing the interface with the person who must use the system. This may simply comprise a list of do's and don'ts on how the system will appear to the user. One example may be a requirement for the option of long or short error messages. Like all others, these requirements should be verifiable, for example, "a clerk typist grade 4 can do function X in Z min after 1 hr of training" rather than "a typist can do function X." (This may also be specified in the Software System Attributes under a section titled Ease of Use.)
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h4>Hardware Interfaces</h4>
        <!-- 
            1 - Specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This includes configuration characteristics (number of ports, instruction sets, etc.) It also covers such matters as what devices are to be supported, how they are to be supported, and protocols. For example, terminal support may specify full screen support as opposed to line by line.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h4>Software Interfaces</h4>
        <!-- 
            1 - Specify the use of other required software products (for example, a data management system, an operating system, or a mathematical package), and interfaces with other application systems (for example, the linkage between an accounts receivable system and a general ledger system).
            2 - For each required software product, the following should be provided:
                a - Name
                b - Mnemonic
                c - Specification Number
                d - Version Number
                e - Source
            3 - For each interface, the following should be provided:
                a - Discussion of the purpose of the interfacing software as related to this software product.
                b - Definition of the interface in terms of message content and format. It is not necessary to detail any well-documented interface, but a reference to the document defining the interface is required.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h4>Communication Interfaces</h4>
        <!-- 
            1 - Specify the various interfaces to communications such as network protocols, etc.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h4>Memory Constraints</h4>
        <!-- 
            1 - Specify any applicable characteristics and limits on primary and secondary memory.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h4>Operations</h4>
        <!-- 
            1 - Specify the normal and special operations required by the user such as:
                a - The various modes of operations in the user organization; for example user-initiated operations.
                b - Periods of interactive operations and periods of unattended operations.
                c - Data processing support functions
                d - Backup and recovery operations
            2 - NOTE: This is sometimes specified as a part of the User Interfaces section.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <!-- 
            1 - Provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform. For example, an SRS for an accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
            2 - Sometimes the function summary that is necessary for this part can be taken directly from the section of the higher level specification (if one exists) that allocates particular functions to the software product.
            3 - Note that for the sake of clarity:
                a - The functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time.
                b - Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships. Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product but simply shows the logical relationships among variables.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h3>User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
        <!-- 
            1 - Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or expertise.
            2 - Describe pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h3>Operating Environment</h3>
        <!-- 
            1 - Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.

        <h3>Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <!-- 
            1 - List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design constraints on the software, but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS.
        -->
            <p>

            </p>
        <h3>User Documentation</h3>
        <!-- 
            1 - List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, online help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.
        -->
            <p>

        <h2>Specific Requirements</h2>
        <!-- 
            1 - Contain all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.
            2 - Every stated requirement should be externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems.
            3 - These requirements should include at a minimum a description of every stimulus into the system, every response from the system, and all functions performed by the system in response to an input or in support of an output.
            4 - The following principles apply:
                a - Specific requirements should be stated in conformance with all of the following characteristics:
                    I - Correct: every requirement is one that the software shall meet.
                    II - Unambiguous: only one interpretation
                    III - Complete:
                        A - All significant requirements listed
                        B - Definition of responses to all inputs and situations, valid and invalid.
