                This document specifies the general requirements of the whole Ecology Sim system. This document regards the software at the highest level of abstraction, considering the general classes of users who will use the system, the functionality they would request, and the resulting flow of data throughout the software's subsystems necessary to accomplish that functionality. This document thus also serves as a catalog of subsystems, each of which requiring their own specification document.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intended audience of this document is, like all documents produced as a part of the Ecology Sim project, primarily myself. While I certainly will reference them in the production of code, the primary reason these documents exist is that the act of producing them with such rigor guides me in the design process. Without them I would be left to aimlessly write code that lacks the cohesion to achieve my goals with this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                A secondary audience to this document is that of any interested contributors to the Ecology Sim project. A solid foundation of specific requirements should help streamline the contribution process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third audience considered in the production of this document is that of any end user who wishes to gain a better understanding of how the system functions.

                Ecology Sim is a software system that simulates a natural environment containing plants and animals. The software simulates the inner subprocesses making up each simulation entity as well as the interactions between entities. The software also tracks changes in the dynamic properties of the simulation and its constituent entities and displays those changes when prompted by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                This software is not designed for large scale simulations. The size of the simulated environment and number of simulated entities are limited by design. Focus instead is placed on the design of sufficiently complex and varied subsystems such that the interactions between them are more interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation generated by the software is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stochastic: The behavior of simulated creatures depends partially on randomly generated numbers.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic: The target of study is the way in which the simulated environment and creatures therein change over time.</li>
                    <li>Temporally Continuous: Updates occur in fixed time steps.</li>
                    <li>Spatially Discrete: Objects in the simulation are placed in the cells of a regular grid.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Ecology Sim software is intended for use by ALife hobbyists and not for serious research. The dynamics involved and design of subsystems are not derived from first principles but instead from higher level abstractions. The goal of the software is to produce interesting interactions.

                                Short for Artificial Life. The field of Alife seeks to understand the processes governing and the processes emerging from natural living systems by means of simulation in or implementation in an artificial substrate.

                                In the field there are two stances regarding whether or not Alife simulations and implementations can be considered to be truly alive in the same way that natural life is.

                                    The <em>Strong Alife</em> position considers life to be a process that can be abstracted away from a certain medium, that so long as the fundamental processes governing living systems are present in a given system it may be considered "alive".

                                    The <em>Weak Alife</em> position denies that Artificial Life is truly alive but instead considers it a model for natural living systems. Like any other model, Alife's main purpose in this stance is to better understand the processes underlying natural living systems.

                                A Dialog is a Window (a Widget not embedded in a parent) that is used for short-term interaction with the user. Typical applications include data entry, warning or error prompts, and about boxes giving information about an application.

Each cell is considered to be adjacent to the cells to the top, bottom, left, right, and all four diagonals to itself (equivalent to a Moore neighborhood in Cellular Automata).

                                An Item is any inert object simulated by Ecology Sim. That is, an Item is an object which does not initiate interactions with any other object. Examples include: rocks and dead Entities.

                                Class Diagrams are tools used in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visually depict the structure of a system by means of enumerating their classes (using the Object Oriented programming paradigm) and the relationships between those classes.

Views are in charge of retrieving data via Model indexes and presenting that data to the user. Views can display underlying data in a variety of ways depending on the View's implementation.

                                Widgets are the fundamental building blocks of GUIs in Qt. Primitive Widgets such as buttons and scroll bars act as basic units of interaction between the user and the program. Composite Widgets contain other Widgets organized by a Layout. A Widget not embedded in a parent Widget is a Window.

            <p>
                The next section, <em>General Description</em>, provides a general overview of the Ecology Sim application, focusing on interactions at the outermost border of the system as well as providing an interface for further requirements on the subsystems. This section doesn't state any specific requirements but rather provides background for those requirements. The Layout system is described and the core user interactions with the GUI's menu functions are laid out. Potential users are grouped based on interest and expertise and those user groups are associated with their most used functions to determine use frequency. The simulation model is briefly described and any topics deep enough for further discussion of requirements are delegated to their own documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The section <em>Specific Requirements</em> then delves into the specific functional requirements governing this level of the system. Each menu function is fully described along with their associated preconditions, input testing, response, etc. The functionality of the Layout system is also described, as well as the requirements for the Widgets therein. Then the highest level requirements to the Model data structures are determined. Additional requirements relating to performance, design constraints, and other requirements are described.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the <em>System Architecture</em> section presents a high-level overview of the anticipated system archictecture using UML Class Diagrams to be later refined in subsequent documentation.

                <h4>User Interfaces</h4>
                <!-- 
                    1 - The logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users. This includes those configuration characteristics (e.g. required screen formats, page or window layouts, content of any reports or menus, or availability of programmable function keys) necessary to accomplish the software requirements.
                    2 - All the aspects of optimizing the interface with the person who must use the system. This may simply comprise a list of do's and don'ts on how the system will appear to the user. One example may be a requirement for the option of long or short error messages. Like all others, these requirements should be verifiable, for example, "a clerk typist grade 4 can do function X in Z min after 1 hr of training" rather than "a typist can do function X." (This may also be specified in the Software System Attributes under a section titled Ease of Use.)

                    <h5>Layouts</h5>
                    <p>
                        The Ecology Sim main window has a dynamic divider-based layout. Users may place Widgets of different functionality arbitrarily within the layout and all existing Widgets will automatically resize to accompany the addition. An example of a possible state of the main application with a layout of 3 Widgets follows:

            <h3>User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
            <!-- 
                1 - Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or expertise.
                2 - Describe pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.
            -->
            <p>
                Though these software requirements are being set out far in advance of any functional prototype being available to users, the following potential user classes have been identified:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Casual User</li>
                <li>Simulation Architect</li>
                <li>Entity Designer</li>
                <li>Long-Term Experimenter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These user classes are listed in rough order of importance. The foremost class is how every user starts out, as a Casual User. Thus the accessibility of the core functionality to that class is most important. The latter classes deal with progressively more nuanced functionality. Often, the requirements pertaining to the former classes also apply to the latter classes. An Entity Designer requires the same functionality as a casual user plus additional functionality.
            </p>
            <div class="sectionBox">
                <h4>Casual User</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the class of users who interact with Ecology Sim on mostly a surface level. A Casual User may open the application, load a template Layout, set up an example Simulation with an example environment and example entities. They may watch the Simulation play out for a few minutes. They may leave it running and return to it later to see how things have evolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Casual User doesn't delve into the subsystems comprising the Simulation, but only passively views the interactions of the running simulation.

            <div class="sectionBox">
                <h4>Simulation Architect</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the class of users that, along with interacting with the surface level functionalities of Ecology Sim, also is interested in the design of Simulations and Environments. A Simulation Architect may use the Environment Editor Widget to create new and interesting settings to see how a Simulation would evolve with it. They may edit the Simulator settings to suit their needs. They also are adept at using the keyboard controls of the Simulator View Widget.
                </p>

            <div class="sectionBox">
                <h4>Entity Designer</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the class of users that, along with interacting with the surface level functionalities of Ecology Sim, also is interested in the design of Entities. An Entity Designer may use the Entity Selector Widget to deeply examine the underlying properties and systems comprising an Entity in the Simulation. They may use the Entity Editor Widget to design custom Entities to see how they fare in Simulations.

            <h3>Functions as Use Cases</h3>
            <!-- 
                1 - Present the use case diagram for the system under development.
                2 - The use case diagram should be a complete version containing all the use cases needed to describe the functionality to be developed.
            -->
            <p>
                All menu functions have been modeled as Use Cases with User Classes as Actors. Each Use Case is given a raw and weighted Use Frequency Score to determine each function's relative importance. Development should progress by implementing the more important functions first. See Appendix <mark>[TODO link to Appendix]</mark> for an explanation of scoring.

            <p>
                Ecology Sim is software primarily developed for a Linux OS given that the current sole developer works on an Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS system at the time of this document's drafting. However, Qt is a cross-platform framework. Thus, it isn't unreasonable to expect development to, at some point, expand to target Windows and Mac systems. Note that this expansion would only take place after the core functionality of the application has been established.

        <h2>Specific Requirements</h2>
        <!-- 
            1 - Contain all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.
            2 - Every stated requirement should be externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems.
            3 - These requirements should include at a minimum a description of every stimulus into the system, every response from the system, and all functions performed by the system in response to an input or in support of an output.
            4 - The following principles apply:
                a - Specific requirements should be stated in conformance with all of the following characteristics:
                    I - Correct: every requirement is one that the software shall meet.
                    II - Unambiguous: only one interpretation
                    III - Complete:
                        A - All significant requirements listed
                        B - Definition of responses to all inputs and situations, valid and invalid.
                        C - Full labels and references to all figures, tables, and diagrams in the SRS and definition of all terms and units of measure
                    IV - Consistent: Internally consistent with other documents.
                    V - Ranked for Importance: Consider the following categories:
                        A - Essential: Software will not be accepted unless these are met.
                        B - Conditional: These requirements would enhance the product, but would not make it unacceptable if they are absent.
                        C - Optional: May or may not be worthwhile.
                    VI - Verifiable: Concrete terms and measurable quantities
                    VII - Modifiable: Format lends itself to editing
                    VIII - Traceable: Reference earlier documents and use unique name or reference number to be referenced by later documents.
                b - Specific requirements should be cross-referenced to earlier documents that relate.
                c - All requirements should be uniquely identifiable.
                d - Careful attention should be given to organizing the requirements to maximize readability.

            <h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
            <!-- 
                1 - Functional requirements should define the fundamental actions that must take place in the software in accepting and processing the inputs and in processing and generating the outputs.
                2 - These are generally listed as "shall" statements starting with The system shall...
                3 - These include:
                    a - Validity checks on the inputs
                    b - Exact sequence of operations
                    c - Responses to abnormal situations, including:
                        I - Overflow
                        II - Communication facilities
                        III - Error handling and recovery
                    d - Effect of parameters
                    e - Relationship of outputs to inputs, including:
                        I - Input/Output sequences
                        II - Formulas for input to output conversion
                4 - It may be appropriate to partition the functional requirements into subfunctions or subprocesses. This does not imply that the software design will also be partitioned that way.
